#### Adding Example Code Snippets Using Markdown 

###### Basic Code Block 
Adding "```" to both sides of the code will mark it as a code block using single color text

```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```


###### Making Code Look Pretty 
specifiing java script after the "```"'s will color the code like it was in an ide 

``` javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```



###### Custom Code
Custom Code added in by myself and not from the template

```
var cd = rm dir root 
```

#### Adding Lists Using Markdown

- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete




etc
